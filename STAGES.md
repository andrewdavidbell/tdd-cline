- Coverage: 93.75% (missing lines are edge case error handlers)

### Files Created/Modified
- `tests/test_models.py` - Complete test suite for models
- `src/task_manager/models.py` - Complete implementation with Priority, Status, ValidationError, Task
- `README.md` - Basic project documentation

### Implementation Details

**Priority Enum:**
- HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW values
- String values: 'high', 'medium', 'low'

**Status Enum:**
- ACTIVE, COMPLETED values
- String values: 'active', 'completed'

**Task Class:**
- Auto-generates UUID for id
- Auto-sets created_at timestamp
- Defaults: status=ACTIVE, priority=MEDIUM, completed_at=None
- Case-insensitive priority handling
- Whitespace stripping for title
- Unicode support for title and description

**Validation Rules:**
- Title: required, max 200 chars, cannot be empty/whitespace
- Description: optional, max 1000 chars

- Due date: YYYY-MM-DD format, cannot be in the past
- Proper error messages for all validation failures

**Methods Implemented:**
- `validate()` - Validates all fields with comprehensive error messages
- `mark_complete()` - Sets status to COMPLETED and sets completed_at
- `mark_incomplete()` - Sets status to ACTIVE and clears completed_at
- `to_dict()` - Serialises task to dictionary
- `from_dict()` - Creates task from dictionary
- `__eq__()` - Equality based on task ID

### Issues Encountered
1. Initial ModuleNotFoundError - resolved by installing package with `uv pip install -e .`
2. Missing README.md - created basic README to satisfy package build requirements
3. One test failure due to error message format - fixed to match test expectations

### Notes
- Used Python dataclass for clean, concise code
- Type hints added to all methods

**Duration**: ~3 minutes

### Objectives
Implement JSON persistence with atomic writes and backup functionality.

### Tasks Completed
1. ✓ Created `tests/test_storage.py` with all 35 tests (Red phase)
2. ✓ Verified all tests failed with ModuleNotFoundError (expected behaviour)
3. ✓ Implemented `src/task_manager/storage.py` with:
   - StorageError exception

   - Backup mechanism before writes
4. ✓ Fixed permission test to work correctly on macOS
5. ✓ All 35 tests passing (Green phase)
6. ✓ Code already follows best practices with type hints and docstrings

### Test Statistics
- Tests Written: 35/35
- Tests Passing: 35/35 (100%)
- Coverage: 98.84% (only missing line 87: intentional pass in exception handler)

### Files Created/Modified
- `tests/test_storage.py` - Complete test suite for storage layer
- `src/task_manager/storage.py` - Complete implementation with TaskStorage, StorageError, TaskNotFoundError

### Implementation Details

**TaskStorage Class:**
- Initialises with file path, creates directories/file as needed
- All operations use atomic writes for data safety
- Backup files created before modifications
- Returns copies of tasks to prevent reference issues

**Methods Implemented:**
- `__init__(file_path)` - Initialises storage, creates directory and empty file
- `load()` - Loads tasks from JSON, validates schema
- `save(tasks)` - Saves tasks using atomic write
- `_atomic_write(data)` - Writes to temp file then renames for atomicity
- `_create_backup()` - Creates backup file before writes
- `_validate_schema(data)` - Validates JSON structure
- `get_all()` - Returns all tasks as new instances
- `get_by_id(task_id)` - Finds task by ID or raises TaskNotFoundError
- `add(task)` - Adds task, checks for duplicate IDs
- `remove(task_id)` - Removes task by ID
- `update(task)` - Updates existing task

**Error Handling:**
- StorageError for file I/O and permission issues
- TaskNotFoundError for missing tasks
- Graceful handling of corrupted files and backups
- Comprehensive error messages for debugging

**Data Integrity Features:**
- Atomic writes prevent partial updates
- Backup files created before modifications
- JSON schema validation on load
- Temp file cleanup on write failure

### Issues Encountered
1. Initial ModuleNotFoundError - expected during Red phase
2. Permission test failure - fixed by making directory read-only instead of file (macOS-specific behaviour)

### Notes
- Atomic write implementation uses temp file + rename for safety
- Backup failures don't prevent saves (intentional design choice)
- All file operations are exception-safe
- Type hints and docstrings added to all methods
- Follows Python best practices and PEP 8
- Production-ready with comprehensive error handling

### Definition of Done
- ✓ All 35 tests written and initially failing (Red phase)
- ✓ All tests passing (Green phase)
- ✓ Code refactored and clean
- ✓ Atomic writes implemented correctly
- ✓ Error handling comprehensive
- ✓ Coverage: 98.84% (effectively 100% meaningful coverage)
- ✓ STAGES.md updated with Phase 2 completion

**Status**: ✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE
