   - Status enum (ACTIVE, COMPLETED)
   - ValidationError exception
   - Task dataclass with all required fields and methods
6. ✓ Fixed validation error message to match test expectations
7. ✓ All 33 tests passing (Green phase)
8. ✓ Code already follows best practices (no additional refactoring needed)

### Test Statistics
- Tests Written: 33/33
- Tests Passing: 33/33 (100%)
- Coverage: 93.75% (missing lines are edge case error handlers)

### Files Created/Modified
- `tests/test_models.py` - Complete test suite for models
- `src/task_manager/models.py` - Complete implementation with Priority, Status, ValidationError, Task
- `README.md` - Basic project documentation

### Implementation Details

**Priority Enum:**
- HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW values
- String values: 'high', 'medium', 'low'

**Status Enum:**
- ACTIVE, COMPLETED values
- String values: 'active', 'completed'

**Task Class:**
- Auto-generates UUID for id
- Auto-sets created_at timestamp
- Defaults: status=ACTIVE, priority=MEDIUM, completed_at=None
- Case-insensitive priority handling
- Whitespace stripping for title
- Unicode support for title and description

**Validation Rules:**
- Title: required, max 200 chars, cannot be empty/whitespace
- Description: optional, max 1000 chars
- Priority: must be HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW (case insensitive)
- Due date: YYYY-MM-DD format, cannot be in the past
- Proper error messages for all validation failures

**Methods Implemented:**
- `validate()` - Validates all fields with comprehensive error messages
- `mark_complete()` - Sets status to COMPLETED and sets completed_at
- `mark_incomplete()` - Sets status to ACTIVE and clears completed_at
- `to_dict()` - Serialises task to dictionary
- `from_dict()` - Creates task from dictionary
- `__eq__()` - Equality based on task ID

### Issues Encountered
1. Initial ModuleNotFoundError - resolved by installing package with `uv pip install -e .`
2. Missing README.md - created basic README to satisfy package build requirements
3. One test failure due to error message format - fixed to match test expectations

### Notes
- Used Python dataclass for clean, concise code
- Type hints added to all methods
- Comprehensive docstrings for all public classes and methods
- Follows PEP 8 conventions
- Code is production-ready with proper error handling

### Definition of Done
- ✓ All 33 tests written and initially failing (Red phase)
- ✓ All tests passing (Green phase)
- ✓ Code refactored and clean (already met best practices)
- ✓ Type hints added to all methods
- ✓ Docstrings added to all public elements

**End Time**: 28/10/2025, 9:43:00 am (Australia/Melbourne, UTC+11:00)
**Duration**: ~3 minutes

### Objectives
Implement JSON persistence with atomic writes and backup functionality.

### Tasks Completed
1. ✓ Created `tests/test_storage.py` with all 35 tests (Red phase)
2. ✓ Verified all tests failed with ModuleNotFoundError (expected behaviour)
3. ✓ Implemented `src/task_manager/storage.py` with:
   - StorageError exception
   - TaskNotFoundError exception
   - TaskStorage class with full CRUD operations
   - Atomic write functionality to prevent data corruption
   - Backup mechanism before writes
4. ✓ Fixed permission test to work correctly on macOS
5. ✓ All 35 tests passing (Green phase)
6. ✓ Code already follows best practices with type hints and docstrings

### Test Statistics
- Tests Written: 35/35
- Tests Passing: 35/35 (100%)
- Coverage: 98.84% (only missing line 87: intentional pass in exception handler)

### Files Created/Modified
- `tests/test_storage.py` - Complete test suite for storage layer
- `src/task_manager/storage.py` - Complete implementation with TaskStorage, StorageError, TaskNotFoundError

### Implementation Details

**TaskStorage Class:**
- Initialises with file path, creates directories/file as needed
- All operations use atomic writes for data safety
- Backup files created before modifications
- Returns copies of tasks to prevent reference issues

**Methods Implemented:**
- `__init__(file_path)` - Initialises storage, creates directory and empty file
- `load()` - Loads tasks from JSON, validates schema
- `save(tasks)` - Saves tasks using atomic write
- `_atomic_write(data)` - Writes to temp file then renames for atomicity
- `_create_backup()` - Creates backup file before writes
- `_validate_schema(data)` - Validates JSON structure
- `get_all()` - Returns all tasks as new instances
- `get_by_id(task_id)` - Finds task by ID or raises TaskNotFoundError
- `add(task)` - Adds task, checks for duplicate IDs
- `remove(task_id)` - Removes task by ID
- `update(task)` - Updates existing task

**Error Handling:**
- StorageError for file I/O and permission issues
- TaskNotFoundError for missing tasks
- Graceful handling of corrupted files and backups
- Comprehensive error messages for debugging

**Data Integrity Features:**
- Atomic writes prevent partial updates
- Backup files created before modifications
- JSON schema validation on load
- Temp file cleanup on write failure

### Issues Encountered
1. Initial ModuleNotFoundError - expected during Red phase
2. Permission test failure - fixed by making directory read-only instead of file (macOS-specific behaviour)

### Notes
- Atomic write implementation uses temp file + rename for safety
- Backup failures don't prevent saves (intentional design choice)
- All file operations are exception-safe
- Type hints and docstrings added to all methods
- Follows Python best practices and PEP 8
- Production-ready with comprehensive error handling

### Definition of Done
- ✓ All 35 tests written and initially failing (Red phase)
- ✓ All tests passing (Green phase)
- ✓ Code refactored and clean
- ✓ Atomic writes implemented correctly
- ✓ Error handling comprehensive
- ✓ Coverage: 98.84% (effectively 100% meaningful coverage)
- ✓ STAGES.md updated with Phase 2 completion

**Status**: ✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE

### Tasks Completed
1. ✓ Created `tests/test_operations.py` with all 40 tests (Red phase)
2. ✓ Verified all tests failed with ModuleNotFoundError (expected behaviour)

   - get_task() - Retrieve task by ID
   - list_tasks() - List with filtering and sorting
   - update_task_status() - Mark complete/incomplete
   - delete_task() - Remove task
   - clear_completed_tasks() - Bulk delete completed
4. ✓ Fixed ValueError to ValidationError conversion for consistent API
5. ✓ All 40 tests passing (Green phase)
6. ✓ Code already clean and well-structured (Refactor phase)

### Test Statistics
- Tests Written: 40/40
- Tests Passing: 40/40 (100%)
- Coverage: 96.43% (missing only default storage path used in production)

### Files Created/Modified
- `tests/test_operations.py` - Complete test suite for operations
- `src/task_manager/operations.py` - Complete implementation of business logic

### Implementation Details

**Functions Implemented:**
- `create_task(title, description, priority, due_date)` - Creates task with validation

### Files Created/Modified
- `tests/test_integration.py` - Complete integration test suite (22 tests)
- `src/task_manager/operations.py` - Added environment variable support
- `src/task_manager/storage.py` - Fixed backup timing

### Implementation Details

**Test Categories:**
1. End-to-End Workflows (7 tests):
   - Create and list tasks
   - Complete tasks and filter by status
   - Full lifecycle (create, update, delete)
   - Multiple tasks with filtering
   - Multiple tasks with sorting
   - Clear completed workflow
   - Persistence across program restarts

2. CLI Integration via Subprocess (5 tests):
   - Add command full workflow
   - List command output formatting
   - Complete command workflow
   - Delete command workflow
   - Invalid command shows help

3. Error Scenarios (4 tests):
   - Invalid due date format
   - Nonexistent task ID
   - Invalid priority value
   - Corrupted storage file

4. Data Integrity (3 tests):
